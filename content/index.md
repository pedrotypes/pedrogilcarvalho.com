# Pedro Gil Carvalho

## bio

<img src="/assets/img/pedro.jpg" class="profilepic">

I'm a dad, a husband, and an engineering leader.

I help others work at their best, and build the organizations in which they thrive.

I gravitate towards e-commerce, API, content, and adjacent areas in high-growth VC-funded startups with international exposure. I've lead engineering and solution architecture teams in such companies for the past 7 years, having been a professional programmer for 15 years before that.

I'm a science nerd. I love lego, star wars, driving, and going for a run now and then. I code for fun. I love traveling and I'm based in Berlin with my wife and our baby daughter.


## recent experience
I'm building out [Lengoo](https://lengoo.com)'s engineering organization in Berlin. I mentor a diverse team of engineers and managers, hire, and provide technical guidance across our products.

Previously, I helped [Contentful](https://contentful.com)'s enterprise customers deliver content-centric software at scale across Europe and North America. I provided their teams with technical guidance and cross-functional organizational coaching.

Before then, I led the Platform Engineering department at [Hellofresh](https://hellofresh.com) HQ in Berlin, where we handled worldwide cloud infrastructure, payments, and public APIs. We grew the engineering organization from 10 to over 100 headcount in my time, laying the foundations of [HelloTech](https://engineering.hellofresh.com/).
