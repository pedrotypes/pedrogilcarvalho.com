I'm a dad, a husband, and an engineering leader.

I've lead engineering and architecture teams for the past 10 years in high growth VC-funded startups. I was a professional programmer for 15 years before that, and still code.

I'm a science nerd. I love lego, star wars, driving, and going for a run now and then. I code for fun. I love traveling and I'm based in Berlin with my wife and our daughters.

## recent experience

Today I'm VP of Engineering at [Terramate](https://terramate.io). I lead a fully distributed Engineering team with members across Europe. We do orchestration and code generation for Terraform, and offer a cloud observability and collaboration product for smart Infra teams. I came in to help the Engineering org grow through the pre-seed an seed stages, working closely with the founders.

Previously I was engineering director at [Getir](https://getir.com). I led one of the few Engineering Tribes that grew while the company contracted. Our fully distributed teams, with members from all over Europe, Middle East and India, raised user onboarding conversion rates, improved push notification open rates, and provided services across all businesses of the company.

I was head of engineering at [Lengoo](https://lengoo.com) before. We delivered translation AI services to businesses and individuals all across. My tenure straddled the pandemic, tackling the unique challenges of the times while growing a diverse and remote-first engineering organization.

For a while, I helped [Contentful](https://contentful.com)'s enterprise customers deliver content-centric software at scale across Europe and North America. Serving as an enterprise solution architect, I provided their teams with technical guidance and cross-functional organizational coaching. All while managing Contentful's European SA team and founding the North American one.

Before then, I led the Platform Engineering department at [Hellofresh](https://hellofresh.com) HQ in Berlin, where we handled worldwide cloud infrastructure, payments, and public APIs. My peers and I we grew the organization from 10 to over 100 headcount and laid down the foundations of [HelloTech](https://engineering.hellofresh.com/).

And before that, I had about 15 years of experience building software. Sometimes alone as a freelancer or founder, mostly as part of teams. The drive to write code never left me. Even today I still identify as a programmer. But I mostly achieve results by enabling other people and finding technical strategies for business needs.
